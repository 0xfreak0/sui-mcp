# Investigating on Sui

Chain records are public, but a tool may not read all of them. Say what was
read, what remains unread, and what the evidence does **not** establish.

## Evidence tiers, and what each licenses

Every claim should be traceable to one of these. Say which.

| tier | means | you may write |
|---|---|---|
| `chain-derived` | Read from Sui itself | "X sent 5 SUI to Y in transaction Z" |
| `price-provider` | An amount read from Sui, valued at a price provider's price (a position's `method` names the provider and the time) | "The position holds 10,140 USDC (chain-derived), about $10,139 at DefiLlama's price at 19:49 UTC" — the amount is a fact, the USD is that provider's quote, not the protocol's own valuation |
| `indexer-attested` | A third party asserts it | "Wormholescan reports this VAA was redeemed on Ethereum" — a lead to confirm, not a finding |
| `heuristic` | An inference from patterns | "These addresses may share an operator" — never "they do" |

`build_wallet_edges` is the tool that tags its output `heuristic`. Its **edges**
are facts with digests attached; its **clusters** are inference. Do not collapse
the two, and never record a heuristic cluster as a finding without confirming it
yourself.

One exception, and it is a different KIND of claim rather than a stronger guess.
A Sui address **is the hash of its authenticator**, so a multisig's committee is
read from the address itself, not inferred from behaviour. Clusters built only
from full-weight `co_signer` edges carry `evidence_tier: "chain-derived"` per
cluster, and you may write "this key can spend that wallet" as a fact. You may
not write that it is the same person: a key is **control**, and a custodian
holds one for a client.

## Opening a case

For someone who lost funds, the `what_happened_to_my_funds` prompt starts with
who can still move what is left, then how it left, where it went and whom to
report to. `was_i_scammed` is its compatibility alias for this release only.

1. **Set your sinks first.** Labels decide where a trace stops. The shipped
   set is first-party disclosures (exchange proof-of-reserves wallets,
   bridge objects from deployment docs, attackers named in the victim's own
   incident report), each with its `source_url`, plus exchange deposit
   addresses inferred from their sweeps into those exchange wallets: label
   "<Exchange> deposit address (inferred)", evidence `sweep-pattern`,
   `inferred_from` with the sweep digests, ranked below every other label.
   Report an inferred one as a lead and re-check it with
   `classify_deposit_address`. Everything case-specific is
   yours to add with `manage_labels`, or point `SUI_LABELS_FILE` at a private
   file for a whole case. A trace that runs past a known exchange, or stops at
   one you never told it about, is usually this. Traces keep following a wallet
   labelled `malicious`.
2. **Identify and measure before you trace.** `identify_address`. A hop that is
   a package or a shared object is not "someone the funds went to", and a trace
   that treats a DEX pool as a person is wrong from that point on. Then
   `summarize_address_flows` over the incident window gives what the address
   took in and sent out per asset, every payer, and every bridge exit with its
   far-side beneficiary, and `screen_address` gives its exposure to labelled
   and sanctioned accounts. For an exploit, `analyze_attack_tx` on one attack
   transaction and `summarize_incident_losses` over all of them say what was
   taken and from which pools.
3. **Trace with `trace_funds`.** Read `stop_reason` and `unfollowed_recipients`
   (forward) or `unfollowed_sources` (backward) *before* the path: a trace
   follows one branch, and splitting across wallets is the ordinary laundering
   move. A hop with `commingled` spent more than the trace delivered to it, so
   from there on the amounts include other funds. A hop is the largest of the
   holder's spends that cover what arrived; the others are its
   `unfollowed_spends`. `kept_as_claim` lists deposits the holder made for a
   share or receipt coin typed over the tracked one (an LP share): the value
   is still the holder's, so they are not hops. A hop with
   `signer_is_sender: false` was signed by `authorized_by` acting for the
   sender (an address alias or a protocol recovery); it is not the sender's own
   act, and a forward trace stops there. When the question is where *all* of
   it went, use `trace_flow_graph`: it follows every branch and reports the
   share of the value under each terminal. Read `coverage.truncated` and the
   `budget` terminal before calling a share final, `truncated` and `omitted`
   before calling a node absent (`detail: "full"` lists every node and edge),
   and remember the shares
   rest on a first-in, first-out convention once funds are mixed. A
   `retained` terminal is value sold for proceeds worth under a tenth of it
   where the object changes show the seller holds no receipt, position or
   table entry for it: the pool or contract it names kept it, so read who
   can withdraw from that object before calling the value gone.
4. **Attribute with `find_funding_source`**, or `find_funding_sources` for
   several addresses at once, which also reports co-funding and its denominators
   and every payment one subject signed to another (`subject_paid_subject`).
   The walk stops at a funder that paid more than 50 distinct addresses at least
   0.01 SUI or $0.10 each: that is an exchange or service, and its own ancestry
   says nothing about the subject. Addresses it paid only dust are counted apart
   (`below_floor_recipients`), so dusting cannot end the walk. It also stops at
   an established funder, one that paid the subject after its own earliest 12
   transactions: it paid from a balance it held, so its ancestry is its own.
   A victim who paid a thief is the case; run `find_funding_source` on that
   funder separately if its own history matters.
   Then measure the funder with `get_address_fanout` before believing anything,
   and run `classify_deposit_address` on a funder or a destination that looks
   like an exchange. A deposit address names the exchange that can identify the
   depositor; chain data does not go further.
5. **Cluster only once you have a reason to.** `build_wallet_edges` answers
   "is this a new party or the same one", not "who is this".
6. **Record with `save_finding`**, one claim per finding, with its `digests`
   and its `evidence_tier` (default `heuristic`). `export_case` groups the
   report by tier when the case outlives the session.

## The control question

**Before treating any shared ancestry as meaningful, ask what the base rate is.**

Several wallets tracing to one funder is damning until you measure the funder:
29,000 recipients is an exchange and the convergence carries no information.

How to actually run the control:

1. `sample_control_addresses` for a comparison group: addresses drawn the same
   way as your subjects but with no reason to be related.
2. Run the *same* test on them. If you are quoting "4 of 6 of these wallets share
   a funder", the number is meaningless until you know what 6 unrelated wallets
   score.
3. Quote both numbers or neither.

The same applies to co-funding. A payout to exactly the two addresses under
investigation is close to decisive; one paying twenty, of which two are yours, is
a list an unrelated wallet lands in by chance. The denominator is
`transaction_recipient_count`. Read it before the group.

## What a cluster actually asserts

`build_wallet_edges` merges a pair on **one** signal at weight ≥ 1.0. It does not
require corroboration, and `medium` confidence is exactly what that looks like.
Do not read a cluster as having cleared a two-signal bar; read the edges.

| signal | what it means |
|---|---|
| `co_signer` (1.5) | A key that can spend the multisig **alone**. Read from the address hash — not behavioural, and the only signal here that isn't |
| `co_signer` (0.6) | On the committee but cannot spend alone. Below the merge floor: a lead, never a cluster by itself |
| `cofunded` | Same first funder, and that funder is not a service |
| `funding_edge` | One address sent the first funding that made the other exist |
| `reciprocal` | Value moved **both** ways, and the counterparty is not a service |
| `sponsor` | Same gas payer — 0.7, cannot merge alone. 1.0 when the sponsor also sent the address its first coin: that is an operator, not incidental gas payment, and merges alone |

These fields decide how much weight a cluster carries:

- **`independent_intermediaries`** — 1 means every edge runs through a single
  address. That is one fact stated many times, not corroboration, and the whole
  cluster falls if that address turns out to be a payout service.
- **`used_intermediaries[].scan_complete`** — `false` means "narrow" is
  provisional. Confirm it with `get_address_fanout` before relying on the cluster.
- **`notes`** — unverified sibling candidates are listed, not dropped. Raise
  `expand_budget` to resolve them.
- **`excluded_co_signers`** — keys sitting on more committees than the limit,
  i.e. custody or wallet-provider keys. Such a key genuinely can spend every
  wallet it signs for, and you may write that. It says nothing about whether
  those wallets share an owner, so do not cluster on it.

An intermediary the shared query budget ran out on before it could be probed
is reported in `excluded_intermediaries` too, distinct from one measured and
found popular: the reason says "not measured" rather than naming a limit. It
is never `used_intermediaries`: an unread popularity is not the same claim as
a narrow one, and a budget-starved probe must never quietly pass as measured.

## A coin's symbol is not its identity

Many unrelated coins share a symbol, including imitators named to be mistaken
for the real asset. Supply and a familiar suffix such as `::usdc::USDC`
prove nothing; a scammer can copy both.

- **`verified: false` means nothing vouches for this coin**, not that it is
  fake. It is still the coin the transaction moved. What you may not write is
  "the attacker moved 10,000 USDC", because you do not know which USDC.
- **A balance change carries `coin_verified`.** Use it. A trace through an
  imitator reads exactly like a trace through the real asset.
- **`assumed scale` means the amount itself may be wrong.** Decimals for an
  unverified coin are a guess and can differ from the asset it imitates. The
  tools read `CoinMetadata` before formatting, so the mark appears only when
  metadata is absent or its read failed.
- **An ambiguous symbol is an answer.** Several legitimate coins share `USDC`:
  Circle's, Wormhole's, Celer's. `analyze_token` returns candidates rather than
  picking. Pass a full coin type; it is the only unambiguous identifier.
- **A symbol nothing curates lists every coin that uses it, up to 100.** When
  dozens of coins share one, `analyze_token` returns them all as
  `candidates`, verified first and then by supply, from a symbol index synced from every
  `CoinMetadata` and coin registry entry. Above 100 coins the index keeps only
  the count: `analyze_token` returns the count and no candidates, and
  `search_token` names such symbols in `unlisted_symbols` without listing
  their coins. The index has a date (`symbol_index.synced_at`): newer coins
  may be missing and are found only by a bounded live scan that says how far
  it got. Supply orders the list and proves nothing.

## A holder scan is not a ranking unless it finished

`get_top_holders` and `analyze_token` walk `Coin<T>` objects and address
balances in **object-id order**, which has nothing to do with balance. A scan
that hits its budget returns the largest holder it happened to see.

- **Check `complete_ranking` before writing any concentration claim.** False
  means the result is `sampled_holders`, carries no rank and no percentage of
  supply, and cannot support "the top 10 hold X%". Each sampled holder's
  `balance` is read directly for that address; `balance_in_sample` and `count`
  are only what the walk saw.
- **A complete scan is a real ranking** and may be used as one. That is only
  reachable for coins and collections small enough to enumerate.
- **Never compare two truncated scans.** Different budgets sample different
  objects, so a difference between them says nothing about the chain.
- **A time-budget stop names its cause.** With `time_budget_reached`, the
  caveat says either that the endpoint answered slower than idle, where a
  retry later at the same `max_scan` may go deeper, or that the requested
  depth does not fit in 35s even idle, where it names a `max_scan` that does.
- **A holder's balance includes its address balance.** `coin_balance` and
  `address_balance` give the split. A holder with `count: 0` holds no coin
  objects at all, and `owner_kind: "object"` means the holder is an object
  (a bridge bank, a DeepBook balance manager), not a person's wallet.

## What a balance change does not show

A balance change nets each owner's coins and address balance per coin type.
Everything that is not a coin (an NFT, a Kiosk, an admin capability) can change
hands with no non-gas balance change.

`trace_funds` reports `object_flow` for this. What it changes about method:

- **Gas-only coin movement does not mean nothing moved.** Read `object_flow`
  and any unread-object caveats before drawing a conclusion.
- **A capability transfer is the finding, and the coin movement may come
  later.** Someone who takes a `TreasuryCap` mints afterwards; someone who
  takes an `UpgradeCap` changes the code afterwards. Trace forward from the
  recipient, not from the money.
- **A renounced capability is the opposite finding.** A cap sent to an
  unspendable address appears in `renounced_capabilities`, not
  `capability_transfers`. It is a risk reduction, not a handover.
- **`high_consequence` is narrow on purpose.** Only `UpgradeCap`,
  `TreasuryCap`, `DenyCap`, `DenyCapV2` and `Publisher` carry a stated power. A
  protocol's own `AdminCap` is flagged as a capability with no claim about what
  it grants. Read the package with `analyze_package` before asserting one.
- **Kiosk moves are custody changes.** A kiosk-held NFT is owned by the Kiosk
  object, so the trade reads `object -> object`. `trace_object_history`,
  `get_object` and `identify_address` name the controlling wallet directly as
  `kiosk_cap_holder`. The kiosk's own `owner` field is self-declared and does
  not follow the `KioskOwnerCap` transfer, so do not read it as the holder.
  `kiosk_cap_holder` is always TODAY's holder: `trace_object_history` attaches
  it only to `current`, never to `created`, a `history` row or an
  `owner_changes` endpoint, and `get_object` skips it for a specific
  `version`. Do not read either as who controlled the kiosk at a past
  version or transaction. A personal kiosk's cap sits inside a
  `PersonalKioskCap`, listed in `kiosk_cap_wrapped_in`, and
  `kiosk_cap_holder` is that wrapper's owner. The wrapper has no transfer
  function, so a thief who wraps a stolen cap this way owns the kiosk for
  good.
- **An unrecorded holder is not evidence of a transfer.** `appeared` means
  the prior holder is missing. Old `deleted` or `wrapped` objects may carry
  `source_unrecorded`; valuation reads their input-version holder, or lists
  them in `objects_unread` if that fails. An unrecorded wrap names no party.
- **A mint to someone else is a delivery.** `get_transaction` lists objects
  created for an owner other than the sender under `created_for`. A publisher
  minting NFTs straight to two wallets produces no transfer and no balance
  change. Coins are never in `created_for`; a drain that pays a beneficiary
  and moves nothing else names it in `coins_delivered_to`.
- **An NFT's USD value is an estimate and says so.** `list_nfts` (`est_usd`)
  and `list_nft_collections` (`estimated_value`) price an item at the lower of
  its collection's lowest active listing and its last sale in the past 30
  days, tier `heuristic`; a listing alone counts only if placed in those 30
  days. A sale at zero, within one address or kiosk, or
  where one side first funded the other is left out and listed with its
  reason under `excluded_sales`. `wash_check` says what was checked; funding
  through an intermediary is not. An unpriced item had no listing and no
  sale in the window this server reads (BlueMove and TradePort's non-kiosk
  listings are not read), which says nothing about what it would fetch. A
  value for a past time uses sales before it and no listings. Report an NFT
  loss apart from coin losses, as an estimate with its basis.

Funds also move without any coin object. An address balance holds funds
credited to an address (or an object id) with no `Coin<T>` behind them:

- **A wallet with no coin objects can still hold funds.** `get_balance` and
  `get_wallet_overview` give `coin_balance` and `address_balance` beside the
  total. A holder with `coin_balance: "0"` shows nothing in
  `list_owned_objects`.
- **Read address-balance activity from the transaction.** `get_transaction`
  lists every deposit and withdrawal under `address_balance_ops`, the
  withdrawals the transaction requested under `funds_withdrawals` (from the
  `sender` or the gas `sponsor`), and `gas_source`. Accumulator writes are not
  objects and are not counted in `object_changes`.
- **A deleted coin is not necessarily spent.** A coin folded into its owner's
  address balance is deleted while its value stays with the owner. That
  deposit carries `converted_from_coins`; `balance_changes` say what the owner
  actually gained or lost.
- **An object can hold funds.** `identify_address` and `get_object` list
  `address_balances` for an object id. Those funds are not among the object's
  fields, and only its defining module can withdraw them.
- **Pre-sign triage reads the withdrawal.** `decode_ptb` shows a
  `FundsWithdrawal` input's `amount`, `coin_type` and `withdraw_from`. A PTB
  that withdraws the whole address balance and calls `send_funds` to a
  stranger moves everything without touching a coin. `presign_context` gives
  each coin's `share_of_balance` (above 1 means more than the sender holds
  now) and each recipient's `first_seen` and `first_digest`. A null
  `first_seen` means the recipient has never appeared on chain; an absent
  one means its history could not be read, which says nothing.
- **A clean pre-sign triage clears nothing.** `decode_ptb` reads only the
  commands, and `checks_run` lists what it checked. A drainer that pays out
  from its own function, not TransferObjects or a framework payout, names no
  recipient in the bytes. `simulate_transaction` shows where every coin and
  object would end up before you sign.

## An address's rendering is not its identity

Wallets and explorers truncate a 32-byte address to something like
`0xa1b2c3d4…e5f60718`. Address poisoning exploits exactly that: an attacker
grinds an address matching the leading and trailing characters of one the victim
already deals with, sends dust from it, and waits for a human to copy the wrong
row out of their own transaction history.

`get_transaction_history`, `trace_funds`, `trace_flow_graph` and
`summarize_address_flows` always report `address_poisoning`, with
`addresses_compared` and the `pairs` of addresses they touched that are close
enough to be mistaken for one another. An empty `pairs` covers only the
addresses in that result, never the wallet's whole history.
`trace_funds` and `trace_flow_graph` also state each pair in the summary,
and a Mermaid or CSV export carries that summary. `trace_flow_graph` and
`find_flow_path` never prune a branch to an address that renders like one
already reached, however small its share, since the small amount is the
finding; a random 3+3 collision in a wide payout is kept the same way.

- **The lookalike is not a counterparty.** It *sends* dust, so it appears only
  as a transaction's sender with a negative balance change. Anything that reads
  the `counterparties` list alone will not see it.
- **The pair is usually hops apart.** In a trace the comparison runs over the
  whole chain, including recipients the trace declined to follow. An
  unfollowed branch imitating a followed one is the branch picked by eye.
- **`direction_known: false` means the roles are not assigned.** The address
  with the larger footprint is named as established, and only when the gap is
  wide enough to carry the claim: dust repeating inside one page is the normal
  shape of this attack, so a 3-vs-1 count is not evidence. Failing that, the
  address that received nothing is the likelier fake. In a transaction
  history, `direction_basis: "lifecycle"` can settle it, but only for the
  poisoner's shape: the later address first appears paying the wallet and
  receiving nothing, within ten minutes of the other, and the other's first row
  is not the oldest shown. First seen is not existed first: a victim who pays
  the lookalike by mistake and then re-pays the real address shows the
  lookalike first. Where NEITHER signal separates them, both are reported and
  neither is called the fake.
- **A flag is about rendering, not intent.** It says two addresses collide in
  a truncated view. Further corroboration: a poisoning wallet is funded,
  fires dust, and sweeps its change back, often inside ten seconds. Check the
  suspect with `get_transaction_history` before writing it up.
- **A clean result covers what was read.** One page cannot establish that the
  wallet was never targeted. Page back with `next_cursor` to cover more.

## Packages: who deployed it, and who can change it

- **`publisher`** (`identify_address`) and **`root_publisher`**
  (`analyze_package`) are the sender of the transaction that created the
  lineage ROOT: the original deployer, the address a trace can follow.
  `analyze_package` also reports **`version_publisher`**, the sender of the
  upgrade that created the version you passed. That is who pushed that code,
  which is the question to ask of an exploited version. The UpgradeCap's
  holder is judged against the root publisher.
- **A party-held cap is held, not shared.** Owner `consensus` is a party
  object: one address owns it and only that address can use it.
- **`holder_status` on the UpgradeCap** answers whether the code can still
  change. `burned` means the cap went somewhere unspendable and upgrade rights
  are renounced. `transferred` means another holder, not wrongdoing on its
  own: teams move caps to treasuries and multisigs deliberately. Identify it.
- **`unresolved` is not `publisher`.** Publish transactions are frequently
  pruned. A failed lookup is "could not check", never "still with the deployer".
- **Diff the upgrade, and its dependencies.** `diff_package_upgrade` returns
  each changed module as unified hunks, `changed_functions` (functions whose
  instructions changed, largest first), the functions that were added,
  removed or made more reachable (`visibility_changes` with `widened: true`),
  and `linkage_changes`, and names the functions in `summary`. Functions are
  matched by name, so a hunk holds only its own function's lines; lines that
  only renumber locals, fields or instruction offsets are counted in
  `renumbered_lines` and a function with nothing else is listed in
  `renumbering_only_functions`. An upgrade can change behaviour by relinking a
  dependency while its own modules barely change; each relinked dependency
  carries the `diff_package_upgrade` call that shows what changed inside it.
  When a module's sample is cut, `unsampled_functions` and
  `partly_sampled_functions` name the functions it leaves out. Follow the tool
  and args in the `sample_next_call` result field to read the omitted code;
  a function missing from the sample has not been shown unchanged.
- **Ask who could upgrade at the time, not only now.** `get_upgrade_history`
  joins every version to its publisher, the publisher's signing scheme and the
  UpgradeCap's holder at that moment, and `as_of` answers for one instant. It
  flags a `cap_round_trip`: the cap leaves its usual holder, a version ships,
  and the cap comes back, as when it is lent for minutes to a single key that
  ships the version. `analyze_package` shows only the holder today.
- **A flaw can predate the lineage.** A redeploy mints an unrelated root, so
  no version walk reaches the code's earlier home. `get_upgrade_history` with
  `find_redeploys: true` compares every version of the lineages whose
  UpgradeCap the publisher or the current cap holder still holds, with
  addresses blanked. `module_origins` names, per module, the earliest version
  here or in a compared lineage that carries that code. A lineage whose cap
  went elsewhere is not found. A module changes whenever any of its code
  does, so read `function_origins` too: it names, per function, the version
  where that function's code first appeared, even when its module changed
  around it, and `declared_changes` names a function that was private or
  package-only at its origin and is exposed now.
- **Read one version's bytecode by that version's address.**
  `disassemble_module` and `get_move_function` return the version whose ID you
  pass; `function_name` returns one function of a module. A `use` line prints
  a dependency's original ID, and its note gives the version and ID this
  package runs (also `get_package` → `dependencies`). To compare versions,
  `diff_package_upgrade` is still the tool.

## Why a transaction failed

`get_transaction` returns `failure` with the abort code, and the package,
module and function that raised it. `get_transactions` names the same kinds
(`MOVE_ABORT` only when there is an abort code; `INSUFFICIENT_GAS` and the
rest from the node's message). Two readings to get right:

- **An abort code is meaningless across packages.** Every package numbers its
  own aborts from zero, so `3` only means something beside the module that
  raised it. A `clever_error`, when present, names the constant the author
  wrote. That is the answer, and the raw code is an implementation detail.
- **Some failures are not rejections.** Congestion cancellation means the
  transaction was never invalid and a retry may succeed; out-of-gas says
  nothing about intent. Do not read either as an attempt that was stopped.

`ADDRESS_DENIED_FOR_COIN` is the exception worth chasing: it means an issuer
had already frozen the sender, which is attribution.

## Frozen addresses

`check_coin_restrictions` reads the on-chain deny list. A freeze is
**chain-derived attribution of an unusual kind**: not a protocol rule, but an
issuer's own decision, recorded on chain and reversible by whoever holds the
DenyCap. Somebody with authority over an asset concluded something about this
address. Note it, and attribute it to the issuer rather than to the
chain.

A freeze by validators, who refuse an address's transactions through their
node configuration, is off chain and in no deny list, so a clean result here
does not rule it out. What shows on chain is indirect: the address stops
sending, and any later movement of its funds is in transactions its owner did
not sign.

- **A frozen address usually holds NONE of the coin that froze it.** Freezing
  and holding are anti-correlated, so an empty balance is not evidence.
- **A global pause is not about any holder.** It says the issuer stopped the
  whole asset.
- **`active: false` is recorded but not in force.** A denial takes effect the
  epoch after it is written.

## Sponsorship

`get_address_fanout` reports `sponsor_shape` alongside value fan-out, because
paying someone's gas moves no value of your own, so a relayer looks narrow by
balance changes and is anything but.

**`relayer` is proven; `private_sponsor` is provisional.** Breadth can grow
with the window. If
`sponsor_shape_provisional` is set, raise `max_transactions` before writing
"narrow". Shared sponsorship through a relayer is not a link on its own, and
it does not rule one out either.

**An `operator` funds the wallets it sponsors.** When a sponsor also sent a
coin to at least half the addresses it pays gas for (`sponsored_and_paid_count`),
`sponsor_shape` is `operator` however many it sponsors. A public relayer pays
gas for strangers it never funded. Shared sponsorship through an operator is a
link between its wallets, the same pair `build_wallet_edges` links as an
operator edge, as when a poisoning operator both funds and sponsors its dust
senders.

**An operator can split the two roles across two addresses.** Funded from one
address and sponsored from another, its wallets show a sponsor that paid none
of them and reads `relayer`. `build_wallet_edges` reads the first funders of
up to six other wallets such a sponsor pays gas for, when the seeds' funder
is itself narrow and unlabelled (an exchange's customers share it anyway;
`role_split.not_checked` says so). When at least three, and
at least half of those read, share the seeds' first funder, it links sponsor,
funder and seeds as one operator and records `role_split` on the sponsor. A
wallet provider that onboards and sponsors its own users shows the same shape,
so check what the linked wallets do before calling them one person.

## Multisig

`identify_address` tells you a wallet is a multisig and names its committee
members. That is chain-derived and costs one query. Three things follow that the
plain reading gets wrong:

- **The committee is fixed by the address.** It is part of the address hash, so
  a member cannot be rotated out the way a Gnosis Safe owner can. Who may spend
  is a separate question: address aliases let a wallet authorize other addresses
  after the fact, so check `aliases` before writing that a committee is the only
  way to move these funds. See "Address aliases" below.
- **Who signs is per-transaction; who is authorised is not.** `get_transaction`
  gives `authorization.signed_by` for one transaction. A member under
  `did_not_sign` is still authorised and may have signed others, so do not
  generalise from one. Use `analyze_multisig` for the wallet-level picture:
  which keys are live, which have never signed, whether the active set shifted.
- **Some committee keys can never sign.** A member marked `unsignable` holds a
  public key written by hand (a readable word padded with zeros), and nobody
  holds its private key. Read the committee as `effective_committee` (a 2-of-4
  with one such member is 2-of-3), and do not describe that member as a cold
  key or a backup.
- **A wallet that has never SENT cannot be classified at all.** No signature, no
  committee. `authentication: null` with a caveat means unknown, not ordinary:
  a receive-only treasury multisig looks exactly like a fresh personal wallet.

A dormancy claim is only as good as the count behind it. "Member 5 has never
signed" over 8 transactions and over 200 are different claims; the tool reports
`transactions_examined` and you should carry it into anything you write.

`find_shared_multisig` searches the other way: given addresses you already
suspect are related, it finds a multisig they jointly control even if it never
appeared in your trace. A hit is proof. A **nil result is not**, because it tests
equal-weight committees of exactly the keys you passed, so it cannot rule out a
weighted committee or one with a member you did not supply.

## Address aliases

An address can authorize up to eight others to act for it (`0x2::address_alias`,
state at `0xa`). `identify_address` reports this as `aliases`.

- **An alias is chain-derived control.** You may write "this address can
  authorize for that wallet" as a fact. You may NOT write that they are the same
  person: a custodian holds authority for a client, the same distinction
  `co_signer` draws.
- **Read `delegated_to`, not `aliases`.** `enable` seeds the set with the
  wallet's own address, so a set holding only the owner means the feature is on
  and nobody else was authorized. `delegated_to` is the set without the owner,
  and an empty one widens nothing.
- **Check `owner_can_authorize` before saying who controls the wallet.** The set
  replaces the signer rather than extending it, so a wallet absent from its own
  set cannot authorize for itself and only `delegated_to` can move its funds.
- **A key acting for many wallets is a service.** Treat it the way
  `excluded_co_signers` treats a custody key.
- **A wallet with no `AddressAliases` object has never enabled the feature**,
  which is the common case. That is an absent field, not a denial.
- **The set is mutable.** `remove` and `replace_all` exist, so an alias is true
  as of the read, not forever. Quote the answer against when you took it. The
  reverse answer (`alias_delegate_for`, `signed_as_alias`) can be up to five
  minutes older than the call; `alias_scan_as_of` is its read time.
- **Check it before concluding a multisig committee is the only spender.** The
  committee cannot rotate; the wallet's alias set can.

## Exploit transactions and incident losses

`analyze_attack_tx` breaks down one transaction; `summarize_incident_losses`
totals many, grouped by the pool each drained.

```
analyze_attack_tx(<digest>)
  profit: +<amount> <coin> $<usd>, one line per coin the attacker gained
  flash swap (calls): <module>::flash_swap repaid by <module>::repay_flash_swap on <pool>
  swap on <pool>: price_change_pct <change> (sqrt price)
  pool <pool> lost $<usd> by its own events
  anomaly outsized-mint: <event> liquidity <credited> for amount_a <a>, amount_b <b>; ticks <lower> to <upper> allow at most <bound>
  anomaly shared-state-jump: <pool> Balance<<coin>> <before> -> <after>; <address> gained this coin

summarize_incident_losses(digests: <every attack digest>)
  $<total> across <n> priced coins; unpriced legs listed, totals.partial: true
  <k> pool groups, largest <pool> $<usd>
```

- **`attacker`/`profit.address` defaults to the sender, not always the
  beneficiary.** When no `attacker` is given and the sender's own coins show
  it only paid gas (a key-compromise operator, or a signer acting on
  someone's behalf), both tools default to the largest PRICED gainer over $1
  in the same transaction(s) instead, reported in
  `attacker_defaulted_from_sender`. A gain in a coin with no price by any
  other non-sender blocks the default (unless the sender itself paid that
  coin out) and keeps the sender, listed in
  `unpriced_gain_candidates`, rather than naming a small priced fee wallet.
  The largest priced gainer's own unpriced coins do not block it; its profit
  is then a partial figure. Pass `attacker` to name a different address once
  you know it. The same default applies when the sender took nothing priced
  and gave valued objects away (a victim signing a drain of staked SUI or LP
  positions); a coin a third-party scam list flags counts as a decoy, not a
  gain.
- **Objects count as value.** Staked SUI, LP positions, lending caps and
  vault receipts that an address received, gave up or kept while the
  transaction changed them are valued at the transaction's checkpoint and
  counted in its net; each is listed with its method in `object_values`
  (`objects` in `summarize_incident_losses`). NFT values are estimates and
  kept out of the totals. `trace_funds` follows such objects when they
  outweigh the coin flow (basis `object`).

- **Balance changes and pool losses are chain-derived.** A pool's loss is summed
  from its own swap and liquidity events. An event belongs to the changed
  shared object whose id one of its fields carries, whatever the field is
  named, and one naming it in a shape the tool does not read is listed in
  `undecoded_events`, not guessed. `value_reconciliation` sets the value that
  came out of objects and mints against what decoded events and the read
  objects' balances paid out (a transfer from one address to another cancels
  out); value neither accounts for came from something not read, and
  `objects_unread` names the objects left unread.
- **A subject that lost value is not a winner.** When the sender or the named
  `attacker` lost value, the headline says so, and `profit.gained_elsewhere`
  names who gained it.
- **Flash legs, oracle touches and anomalies are heuristic.** They are matched
  on function and event names, the PTB's data flow and who published each
  called package. Check the paired calls before writing "flash loan" in a
  report.
- **An empty anomaly list clears nothing.** `checks_run` names every check
  that ran, with its rule. An exploit can use a shape none of them reads, so
  report which checks ran and matched nothing, never that the transaction is
  clean.
- **Four anomalies point at the code to read.** `shared-state-jump` reads
  each changed shared object at the transaction's input and output versions
  (`state_deltas`): a stored number that moved 100x or more (a price, an
  index, a liquidity, a counter), a `Balance<T>` holding drained 100x or to
  zero (a pool's or a vault's reserve), or by less when its holder lost at
  least half of its priced value and addresses gained at least half of that
  (`drops[].value_share_lost`), or a value taken from an object other than
  the one it references.
  It is high when the new number is one the caller passed, when
  addresses gained at least half the drained value in any coin, or for a
  wrong source; a holding drained into other objects (a staking buffer
  staked out) or swapped by its holder for other coins worth 90% of what it
  paid out reads info.
  `caller-value-used` means a value the caller passed, directly or through
  calls built only from pure inputs, was stored in a changed shared object
  (passed directly, or carried inside an earlier command's result) that a
  later call read (a price the caller set, then a swap priced by it),
  including a set, use and
  restore that leaves the field as it was. It is high when that field's
  values span 10x inside the PTB and medium otherwise, as a keeper's
  set-and-settle or a swap stopping at its price limit reads; a signature on
  the writing call lowers the grade by one step. It is also medium when an
  event naming the object states the caller's value times another of its
  numbers, scaled by a power of ten (`product`). `caller_value_writes` lists
  every write with the `fields` that hold the value, and `value_signed` when
  the value reads as negative. No `caller-value-used` does not clear a call:
  a value restored before the final write can escape the rule when no event
  tracks the field, so read `decode_ptb` and the called bytecode.
  `outsized-mint` means a liquidity event
  credited more than its amounts buy on its own tick range at any price, or
  an event minted a share of an object's `Supply<T>` more than 100x the share
  of the object's own holdings its deposits make up.
  `unreconciled-gain` (info) means
  value reached addresses that nothing decoded or read paid out, priced or
  not. `flagged_commands` lists the commands behind the high and medium
  anomalies, and its `next_call` decodes the most severe with `decode_ptb`.
  Read the
  writing or pricing function next with `get_move_function` and
  `disassemble_module`.
- **Three anomalies point at a price, a key or a vault's history.**
  `price-off-market` compares each price the transaction states for one coin
  (an event naming that coin, or a table row keyed by its type after the
  transaction) with the provider price at block time. A field counts as a
  price only when, at one power of ten, it agrees within 5% with the
  provider for at least two coins and half the priced coins it names; a coin
  5x or more from its provider price there is flagged, high at 10x
  (`off_market_prices`). It names a coin valued with another asset's feed or
  at a price someone signed, including one set and restored inside the PTB.
  Read which feed or slot the protocol resolves that coin to with
  `get_object`. `signing-key-replaced` (medium) means a changed shared
  object's byte string of a public-key length (33, 48, 64, 65 or 96 bytes)
  now holds another key: whoever holds the new key signs what that object
  vouches for, such as an oracle's prices. A rotation by the operator reads
  the same. `share-round-trip` means the sender receives 1.1x or more
  (high at 2x) what it paid within the previous day for the vault shares it
  burns, per share against its own mints of that coin on the same vault, or
  for a position object against the transaction that created it
  (`round_trips`): the shares were issued against holdings the vault
  understated, whichever version or price did it, and the redemption takes
  the difference from the other holders. Both legs are valued at the exit's
  prices only when they trade the same coins one way each; a zap into another
  coin, or a leg that borrows or repays, is valued at each leg's own time and
  counts only from 2x (`basis: "own-time"`), since a price move or leverage
  alone can make a day's trade gain a tenth. Read the entry transaction with
  `analyze_attack_tx` next. `round_trips_unread` names unread comparisons;
  their absence from `round_trips` is not a negative finding.
- **`switched-before-execution` catches a bait-and-switch.** A signature
  binds a shared object by id, not by its contents, so whoever may write it,
  and whoever submits the signed bytes (a gas sponsor), can change where the
  signer's value goes after the signer approved. The check follows each
  shared object the transaction took back through the writes of the minute
  before it, by other senders, and keeps those that flipped a boolean, set
  an address that gains value in the transaction, or set a number equal to an
  amount it moved (`recent_foreign_writes`). It reads high within 10 s when
  the signer lost $1 or more to other addresses, medium within the minute,
  info when the signer lost nothing. A keeper writing the same object reads
  the same; `trace_object_history` shows the object's writes.
- **The PTB checks run here too.** `analyze_attack_tx` runs `decode_ptb`'s
  checks with the transaction's sender and effects. A name is not trust:
  `unverified-package-call` means neither the curated registry nor a curated
  protocol's publishing key vouches for a called package, whatever its Move
  Registry name. It reads info when nothing of value moves through it, and,
  for an executed transaction, when the value came back to the sender and no
  other address gained what the sender lost.
  `stale-package-version` at medium means a superseded version wrote its own
  lineage's shared objects with a function the newest version changed or
  removed, so the call ran logic the lineage has since replaced. At info it
  only says an old version ran. A
  `transfers-to-non-sender` line marked `by effects` is a payout no command
  names.
- **USD is a provider's quote, not an execution price.** Coin legs in
  `summarize_incident_losses`, `summarize_address_flows` and `aggregate_events`
  P&L are priced near each transaction's time, per the pricing block's method,
  then summed. Read `usd_basis` (`pnl.usd_basis` for P&L), not one median
  price. Incident `price_at` overrides this with one fixed time.
  Report raw token amounts as exact and USD as estimated; say when a total is partial.
- **Unpriced legs make USD partial, not a lower bound.** Missing debits can
  raise a net. Check incident `totals.partial` and `unpriced_remainder`,
  flow `totals_usd.partial`, or P&L `pnl.usd_basis.partial`, and quote raw
  priced/unpriced coverage. Unknown decimals, missing timestamps or prices,
  and pricing-budget stops leave amounts unpriced; there is no current-price
  fallback. `analyze_attack_tx` instead reports per-coin `price_offset_sec`
  and optional confidence; a post-exploit quote may already reflect the loss.
- **What the attacker sent on is not part of the take.** A coin the attacker
  paid to another address, in a transaction where that coin moved only
  between addresses, is listed in `transfers_out` with every recipient and
  kept out of the totals and groups. Follow those recipients; they are often
  the attacker's own next wallets. A vault that emits no pool event is still
  a group: its `pool_basis` is `"state"`, read from the holdings that fell.
- **Groups are exact pool sets, and a sender window is not the take.** A
  transaction touching several pools has one attacker net that cannot be
  split among them, and one vault's deposits and withdrawals over different
  sets stay separate groups, so the largest group's `attacker_usd` need not be
  that vault's total loss. `sender` mode nets the attacker's swaps, deposits,
  withdrawals and bridge burns in the window against the exploit credits;
  pass the exploit digests to measure the take.

`summarize_address_flows` answers the next questions about the attacker's
wallet: what it took per asset, who paid it, and what left Sui to where.

```
summarize_address_flows(<attacker>, from: <window start>, to: <window end>)
  coverage: <n> transactions, complete
  inflow_sources: <address> <amount> SUI (<n> txs), …
  unattributed_inflows: <amount> <coin>, … (exploit and swap proceeds)
  bridge_exits.by_bridge: <bridge>, <n> txs, <amount> <coin> → <chain>:<address>
```

- **`unattributed` is value no address paid or received**: swap proceeds,
  protocol withdrawals, the exploit itself, burns. Its digests say which.
- **Gas is reported apart.** SUI totals exclude it, and a sponsor's storage
  rebate is never a counterparty.
- **Beneficiaries are chain-derived.** A Wormhole message whose payload names
  no recipient is listed in `unresolved_vaas`; `resolve_bridge_transfer` asks
  Wormholescan where it was redeemed.
- **Check `coverage.complete` and `coverage.incomplete_transactions`.** A
  stopped scan covers only `coverage.oldest` onwards.
  `coverage.continue_with` re-reads the boundary checkpoint; drop duplicate
  digests before combining results.

`aggregate_events` with `group_pnl` asks who else profited from the
manipulated state:

```
aggregate_events(module: "<called package id>::<module>", from: <window start>, to: <window end>, group_pnl: true)
  pnl.senders: <attacker> $<usd> (the exploit, <n> txs)
               <address> $<usd>: +<amount> <coin>, … (<n> txs, multi-leg)
```

- **Filter by `module` at the version that was called.** `event_type` matches
  one event struct, so a `SwapEvent` window misses the `claim_reward`
  transactions that paid out.
- **P&L is the sender's whole balance change in those transactions**, gas
  included. `multi_leg_transactions` and `other_packages` say when a PTB also
  went through another protocol, where the profit may have been made.
- **Aggregate slices are not cumulative.** Continue with `scan.next_call`.
  Only per-key counts and `value_sum` add across disjoint slices, subject to
  rounding, and only if `scan.groups_complete` is true in every slice.
  Top-N rankings, `distinct_keys`, distributions and group P&L do not add.
  A resumed ranking stays `truncated` even when it reaches the end.

## Finding the flaw in the code

The exploit transaction names every function it called, and every version's
bytecode is on chain, so the mechanism can be read rather than guessed. Work
from the exploit to the code. Starting from the upgrade list assumes an
upgrade introduced the flaw, and many shipped with the first publish.

1. **Name the calls and read their arguments.** `decode_ptb` with `digest`
   lists each command's arguments: the objects passed, pure values decoded
   against the called function's signature, and which earlier result fed
   which call; its `inputs` give the version of each object the transaction
   read. `analyze_attack_tx` marks the oracle writes and flash legs among
   them, and its `caller-value-used`, `shared-state-jump`, `outsized-mint` and
   `stale-package-version` anomalies point at the command and the object to
   read first; `flagged_commands.next_call` lists just those with
   `decode_ptb` `commands: [i, j]`, and `decode_ptb`'s own first page puts
   the commands its anomalies name ahead of the rest. A pure integer whose
   top bit is set also carries `signed_value`, since Move code can read it as
   two's complement.
   `get_transaction` with `detail: "full"` carries the same program beside
   every event and object change, at several times the size; an event number
   in the top half of `u256` carries `signed_readings`. The anomalies
   are heuristic leads, not the flaw. An object the attacker passed that
   belongs to someone else (another user's account, another market's pool) is
   often the whole exploit.
2. **Read the version that ran.** A call names the package version it went
   through. `get_upgrade_history` with `as_of` at the
   exploit says which version was newest then; read the function at the
   address the transaction called, with `get_move_function` for its signature
   and `disassemble_module` with `module_name` and `function_name` for its
   body. Follow the calls it makes the same way. `analyze_package` on that
   version traces each function's data flow and lists graded leads with the
   instructions behind them: a check whose bool reaches nothing
   (`discarded-check`), a public function that skips a check its siblings on
   the same object type make (`sibling-guard-gap`), and a caller's value
   written into a shared object with no comparison against stored state
   (`unchecked-state-write`). A lead says where to read, not that the code is
   wrong, and a function with no lead has not been cleared: `bytecode_scan`
   names the three shapes checked. Weak leads raise no finding and are listed
   in `bytecode_scan.weak_leads` (the first few by default, all with
   `detail: "full"`); `bytecode_scan.read` says how to read one.
3. **Check every version of the lineage the exploit ran.** Older versions stay
   callable against the shared objects newer versions manage, unless each
   checks a version number that newer code raises. `stale-package-version`
   names a call through a superseded version and whether the newest version
   changed that function. Read the older function's gate with
   `disassemble_module` and `function_name`: a version check the newer code
   makes and the older one lacks leaves every later fix open through the old
   version. When an upgrade moved where an object keeps its state, or changed
   what a stored figure means, old and new code can each act on a figure the
   other rewrote. `analyze_package` on any version of the lineage raises
   `ungated-older-version` when an older version's public functions mutate a
   shared type without the check most of the newest version's public
   functions on that type make; read the function it names with
   `disassemble_module` at that version's package id. `diff_package_upgrade`
   between the two versions dates the gate and the move.
4. **Read the objects around the exploit.** `query_transactions` with
   `affected_object` lists the transactions that changed a shared object the
   exploit changed, the attacker's setup included; one that only read it can
   be absent. `get_object` with
   `version` reads its fields at any version. `get_transaction` with
   `detail: "full"` → `object_changes.by_kind` gives the version each
   transaction left a changed object at, which reaches an object held in a
   dynamic field that no command names; an object passed as an input also
   shows the version read in `decode_ptb`'s `inputs`. The state before the
   first step and between steps shows what each call relied on.
5. **Check the dependencies it linked.** Bytecode names a dependency by its
   original id (`use 0x<original id>::<module>`), and reading that id returns
   the first version. `disassemble_module` notes the linked version's ID on
   that line (`// linked version <n>: 0x<id>`), and `get_package` →
   `dependencies` lists the same; read the code at that ID.
   `get_package_dependency_graph` reads the dependencies' own linkage. A flaw in a
   dependency shows in none of the protocol's own module diffs.
6. **Date the flaw with diffs.** `diff_package_upgrade` on the fix shows what
   closed it: the protocol's next version, or an upgrade whose change is a
   relink (`linkage_changes`, each carrying the diff inside the dependency).
   Its `changed_functions` names each function whose body changed. The same
   diff on the version that introduced the code dates the flaw. Either upgrade
   may be missing: the flaw may date from the first publish or from an earlier
   deployment of the same code, the exploited version need not be the one that
   introduced it, and a protocol may answer by pausing or draining pools with
   no upgrade at all.
7. **Say what you read and what you inferred.** A missing check, a wrong
   bound or a discarded result read from bytecode is a fact about the code.
   How the attacker's values moved through it, and which step is the root
   cause, stay inference until each is matched to an instruction you read and
   a value in the transaction.

`diff_package_upgrade`, `get_package_dependency_graph` and `decode_ptb` are in
the `developer` profile. `decompile_module` renders the same bytecode as Move
source when `SUI_DECOMPILER_PATH` points at a decompiler binary. It is an
optional aid for reading, and every step above works without it.

## Which tool answers what

Use the tool for the question before writing raw GraphQL. Its response carries
the coverage and continuation rules a hand-written query must supply itself.

| question | tool |
|---|---|
| What is this address? | `identify_address`. For a package, `bridge_carrier` lists calls into a bridge's exit entry: it can send bridge transfers for its callers |
| Is this address fresh? | `identify_address` → `first_seen` (oldest transaction, sender, coins received). `first_inflow` is also true for genesis allocations: their null sender names no funding wallet. A null `first_inflow` means unread balance changes |
| Where did the money go / come from? | `trace_funds` (one branch), `find_funding_source` |
| Where did ALL of it go, and how much reached each exit? | `trace_flow_graph` → `terminals`, `coverage` |
| Is there any path from this wallet to that one (or to a foreign account a bridge paid)? | `find_flow_path` — a miss is not evidence; read `explored` |
| A diagram for the report? | `format: "mermaid"` on `trace_flow_graph`, `find_flow_path`, `trace_funds`, `build_wallet_edges`; `export_case` with `format: "mermaid"` |
| Several addresses at once? | `find_funding_sources` — shares work, reports co-funding |
| Is this funder an exchange? | `get_address_fanout` |
| Is this an exchange deposit address, and whose? | `classify_deposit_address`, with `from` and `to` for the period that matters. `summarize_address_flows`, `identify_address` and `manage_labels` lookup show the inferred deposit label or a verdict computed earlier in the session for the same period, and otherwise say `not classified` with the call to run |
| Is this address exposed to an exploiter, exchange, bridge or sanctioned account? | `screen_address` |
| Do these wallets share an operator? | `build_wallet_edges` |
| Who really runs this multisig treasury? | `analyze_multisig` — live vs dormant keys across its history |
| Which keys signed THIS transaction? | `get_transaction` → `authorization.signed_by` |
| Do these wallets share a multisig I haven't seen? | `find_shared_multisig` |
| Is this wallet automated? | `build_timeline` with `activity_hours` |
| Where does this trace stop, and why? | `manage_labels` — sinks are yours to set |
| What did this transaction do, with event values? | `get_transaction` |
| Which objects and values did each command receive? | `decode_ptb` with `digest` → `inputs` (each object with the version the transaction read), `commands` (each argument resolved to an object, a pure value or an earlier command's result); commands are paged at about 30k characters with the commands an anomaly names first, `commands_omitted` gives the exact ranges left out, `commands: [i, j]` lists exactly the calls you need and `command_offset` continues a page. `get_transaction` with `detail: "full"` carries the same beside every event and object change, at several times the size |
| Did it touch anything, when it moved no coin? | `get_transaction` → `command_count`, `object_changes`, `object_transfers`, `created_for`, `mutated_capabilities` (a capability that authorised the call by mutating itself, not by changing hands); with `detail: "full"`, `object_changes.by_kind` lists each object's id, type and version, dynamic fields of one type folded into one row with `object_ids`. Adding `commands: [i, j]` narrows `events` (each names its `command`, or `commands` when neighbouring calls share a module), `inputs` and `object_changes.by_kind` to those commands; `events_omitted`, `inputs_omitted` and `object_changes_omitted` count the rest |
| Did funds move without a coin object? | `get_transaction` → `address_balance_ops`, `funds_withdrawals`, `gas_source` |
| Which protocol took a fee, and to whose key? | `get_transaction` → `protocols` (a package published by a curated protocol's key is named after it), and `publisher_key_of` on a `balance_changes` row whose address signed that protocol's packages |
| Funds held by an object? | `identify_address` or `get_object` → `address_balances`; `get_balance` with the object id as `owner` |
| Coin objects or address balance? | `get_balance`, `get_wallet_overview` → `coin_balance`, `address_balance` |
| What did this address hold before/after the incident? | `get_balance` with `at` or `at_checkpoint` → `balance` only when `complete` is true |
| What did this wallet stake then? | `get_staking_summary` with `as_of` (date or checkpoint): directly held StakedSui, including transfers and split/joined stakes. Historical rewards are separate estimates; incomplete reads give null totals. A rebuild that stops returns `continue_with`, which resumes where it stopped. Wrapped stakes and liquid-staking tokens are excluded |
| Which validators are active? | `get_validators` defaults to compact summary rows; `detail: "full"` returns all fields and rows unless `limit` is set. `active_validator_count` and `total_stake` cover the whole set; `validator_count` counts displayed rows |
| Several digests at once? | `get_transactions` — up to 50 in one call |
| What does this unknown package do? | `analyze_package` — per-module API summary and capability audit; `modules: [...]` for those modules' struct shapes and signatures |
| Who deployed this package, and who pushed this version? | `analyze_package` → `root_publisher`, `version_publisher` (`identify_address` → `publisher`) |
| What did an upgrade change? | `diff_package_upgrade` → `summary`, `changed_functions`, hunks, `visibility_changes`, `linkage_changes` |
| How did this exploit work? | "Finding the flaw in the code": the calls (`decode_ptb`), then `get_move_function` and `disassemble_module` with `function_name` on each version of the lineage that ran |
| What did a shared object hold before, between or after the attack's steps? | `query_transactions` with `affected_object` for the transactions that changed it (one that only read it can be absent), then `get_object` with `version`; `get_transaction` with `detail: "full"` → `object_changes.by_kind` gives the version each transaction left it at, and `decode_ptb` → `inputs` the version read for an object passed as an input |
| Which version of a dependency did this package run? | The note on the dependency's `use` line in `disassemble_module`, or `get_package` → `dependencies`; `get_package_dependency_graph` for dependencies of dependencies |
| Can the code still be changed, and by whom? | `analyze_package` → the UpgradeCap's `holder_status` |
| Who pushed each version, with one key or a multisig, and who held the UpgradeCap at time T? | `get_upgrade_history` → per-version `signer`, `cap_holder`, `flags`; `as_of` for a moment |
| Why did this transaction fail? | `get_transaction` → `failure` (abort code, module, function) |
| Has an issuer frozen this address? | `check_coin_restrictions` |
| Is this coin the real one? | `analyze_token` → `verified`; traces carry `coin_verified` per balance change |
| Is this address the one it looks like? | `get_transaction_history`, `trace_funds`, `trace_flow_graph` or `summarize_address_flows` → `address_poisoning` |
| Did something move that was not a coin? | `trace_funds` → `object_flow`, and `object_values` per hop with USD for staked SUI, LP positions, lending caps and vault receipts |
| What is this wallet worth beyond its coins? | `get_wallet_overview` with `include_prices` → `positions_value_usd`, `unread`, `coverage`, and with `include_nfts` `nft_estimate_usd` (estimates, not in the total); `get_defi_positions` for every position with its `method` and `tier`. The total covers only recognised positions: `coverage.not_recognised_types` lists owned objects left out by type and count, so do not present it as the wallet's complete net worth |
| Does this wallet run its money through a vault it does not own? | `get_wallet_overview` with `include_prices` or `get_defi_positions` → `leads` of kind `operated_shared_object`: a shared object its recent transactions used whose own fields name it (`members`, `owner`, `operator`, ...), with what it holds and the other addresses named. The naming is chain-derived; what the role lets the address do is in the package's functions |
| What does this wallet owe or lend, and how close is it to liquidation? | `get_defi_positions` → lending positions with supply and borrow legs, `health` (what the protocol stores: Suilend's and AlphaLend's totals as of the last refresh, Bucket's minimum collateral ratio, plus `borrow_limit_used` and `liquidation_threshold_used` from those figures), `health_basis` when the stored figures and the legs' market value differ (use `health` for distance to liquidation, `usd` for worth), `leads` for a position within 5% of its borrow limit, and `price_check` wherever the protocol's oracle and a provider disagree by more than 2% (the provider's price is then used; a large gap is a lead on a borrowed or manipulated feed, not a verdict) |
| Who can mint / upgrade / freeze, and did that change hands? | `trace_funds` → `object_flow.capability_transfers` |
| Does this address pay other people's gas? | `get_address_fanout` → `sponsor_shape` |
| Events of a given type across time? | `query_events` — returns decoded fields |
| What happened between two times? | All four take ISO bounds or checkpoints, under different names: `query_transactions` and `query_events` as `after_checkpoint`/`before_checkpoint` (an ISO time is accepted there), `build_timeline` and `aggregate_events` as `from`/`to`. `get_checkpoint {timestamp}` gives the checkpoint |
| Did value leave the chain? | `trace_funds` reports `bridge_exits`; then `resolve_bridge_transfer` → `beneficiaries`. `redeemed_via_contract`, a LayerZero `destination_oapp`, a CCTP leg marked `settlement_intermediate`, a Wormhole message marked `settlement_message` (a Mayan order's own message, never redeemed, or the message of an Allbridge pool transfer sent through Allbridge's Wormhole messenger) and a CCTP leg that `carries` an Allbridge transfer are bridge contracts, messages or intermediate accounts, not the recipient. `carried_by` names the one protocol the transfer went through when others settled it (`settled_over`); `also_exited` names any other bridge the transaction used, whose recipient is a separate destination. `carriers` names a package that made the bridge call on the sender's behalf (an adapter or aggregator), with its function and its own events such as an order id |
| Did value leave through a bridge this server does not recognise? | `cross_chain_leads` in `resolve_bridge_transfer`, `summarize_address_flows` and on `trace_flow_graph`'s consumed terminals: events carrying a chain field and a foreign-address-sized byte string, tier heuristic. Read the emitting package before calling it an exit; no `cross_chain_leads` does not rule out a bridge that encodes its destination another way |
| Where did money arriving on Sui come from? | `resolve_bridge_transfer` on the redeeming transaction → `sui_native_bridge_inbound` / `wormhole_inbound`: origin chain and transfer id (VAA id). A solver or relayer fulfilment by any other package → `fulfilment_inbound`: origin chain, CCTP transfer id and VAA id, and the beneficiary credited the amount its events state. A heuristic origin or beneficiary is a lead, not a finding |
| What did this exploit transaction take, and how? | `analyze_attack_tx` — per-address net in USD, flash legs, pool price moves, pool losses, oracle touches |
| Which pools were drained in this incident, and for how much? | `summarize_incident_losses` — per-pool losses and a USD total, unpriced coins listed |
| Who else profited in this window, and by how much? | `aggregate_events` with `module` and `group_pnl` — each sender's own balance changes in USD, multi-leg PTBs marked |
| How much did this address take per asset, who paid it, and how much left Sui to where? | `summarize_address_flows` — per-coin totals in USD, valued objects in and out (`objects`, counted in `totals_usd` and with their counterparty), inflow sources, top recipients, gas sponsors, bridge exits grouped by destination; totals and `inflow_source_count` cover every row, and `detail: "full"` lists every source |
| What was this coin worth at the time? | `get_token_prices` with `at` — no key needed; says which coins it could not price and why: a failed request, no quote, or `out_of_range` when no selected provider serves that date |
| Where did this object come from? How did it change just before the incident? | `trace_object_history` — reaches a deleted or wrapped object (`end`), and a distant transition on a capability mutated on every privileged call, without paging through every version; `order: "newest"` lists the latest versions first and `next_call` pages back |
| Who holds this token? | `get_top_holders` — a ranking ONLY when `complete_ranking` is true; walks coins and address balances |
| Has anything moved since I looked? | `watch_addresses` then `poll_watch` |
| What is this address doing over time? | `build_timeline` |
| Write it down / hand it over | `save_finding`, `list_findings`, `export_case` |

If a tool seems missing, call `enable_tools`. It is probably disabled rather
than absent. It takes `profile: "developer"` or `profiles: ["forensics",
"developer"]`. Calling a disabled tool returns the profile to enable.

Address arguments take any case, a short form or a SuiNS name. A name is
resolved at call time and reported as `resolved_from`; it points wherever its
owner set it today, so cite the address, not the name.

A field set to `null` with a `*_unavailable` note beside it (`sui_balance`,
`sui_name`, `token_count`, `staked_sui_count`, `kiosk_count`) means the read
failed. It is
unknown, not zero, and not evidence of an empty or unused wallet. Retry before
drawing anything from it.

Batch digests through `get_transactions` rather than looping
`get_transaction`. Check `object_transfers` and `created_for` even when coin
balances did not change: an NFT, position or StakedSui can move on its own.
Owner `kind` distinguishes an object or kiosk from a wallet. When
`object_changes_truncated` is true, read `get_transaction` for the complete
object changes before concluding that nothing moved.

## Conclusions to refuse

- **"No edge found, so they are unrelated."** Every signal comes from a capped
  scan of public data. Two wallets funded out-of-band and never co-appearing
  produce no edge no matter who controls them. Absence is not evidence.
- **"The trace ended, so the money stopped."** A forward trace stops when the
  recipient has not spent *yet*, when the value went into a protocol (the
  depositor holds the claim), at a bridge exit, or at a hub whose next outflow
  is someone else's money. Forward, a hub is an address that 100 or more
  distinct senders pay into; one paid by a few that pays hundreds (a theft
  wallet, an operator's disperser) is followed, and so is any wallet labelled
  malicious. Check `stop_reason`, which is always set.
- **"Funds sent to an address went to a wallet."** A `Receiving<T>` transfer
  (a zkSend link) pays an object's id. `identify_address` reports
  `wrapped_or_deleted_object` for such an id, and `trace_funds` follows the
  value out of it (`reached_via: "released-from-object"`).
- **"Nothing was found, so nothing exists."** A pruned transaction and a wrong
  digest look identical. `not_found` is "could not look", not "not there".
- **"They share a funder, therefore an operator."** Only if that funder is
  narrow, and a single narrow funder is all `medium` confidence rests on.
  Corroboration is what moves it past that.
- **"A batch payout means shared control."** Twenty addresses paid 5 SUI each in
  one transaction share a list, not an operator.
- **"The exchange deposit means they cashed out."** A deposit on Sui and a
  withdrawal elsewhere cannot be linked from chain data. That is a subpoena,
  not a query.
- **"Flat activity means a bot."** Only above a real rate. A wallet transacting
  twice a week cannot show a daily rhythm whoever is behind it, and
  `automation_indicated` stays false for exactly that reason.
- **Naming a real person or company** from chain data plus a matching username.
  Handles are not unique and squatting is routine.
- **An expired SuiNS name the address registered is still attribution; a name
  it was sent is not.** Reverse lookup goes silent once a name lapses, so
  `names_held` carries former aliases. Each entry has a `provenance`:
  `registered_or_used` means the holder sent the last transaction that wrote
  the registration, so the name is its own. `received_from_third_party` means
  another address (`received_from`, in `last_tx`) delivered it and the holder
  has not transacted with it since. Anyone can send a name NFT to any address,
  so treat a received name as a message from the sender, never as the holder's
  alias. `unknown` means the transaction could not be read. Do not read the
  current name as the only one.

## Traps in the data itself

- **A display limit is not a scan limit.** `omitted.lists` names rows left out
  of the answer, with their priced USD, unpriced count and largest value.
  Display capping keeps totals over every row read and preserves flagged rows.
  A scan stopped early has incomplete coverage; `detail: "full"` cannot
  finish it. A folded `get_transaction` event row's `count` and `varying`
  describe several events, not one event's values.
- **`detail: "full"` lifts the display cap.** Follow `omitted.next_call`, or
  read a list's `page` URI with `match` when the store is on. For validators
  it also includes fields omitted from summary rows.
- **An empty page can still have a next page.** For `query_events`,
  `query_transactions` and `aggregate_events`, continue while
  `has_next_page` is true, even with no rows. Queries fill across short
  service reads; `scan` reports a read-budget stop. Aggregates also stop at
  `max_events`: read `scan.stop_reason` to distinguish it from `max_reads`.
  Follow `scan.next_call`; `repeat_with` patches the original arguments.
  Keep the filters and order, and treat cursors as opaque, not checkpoints.
- **Follow continuations on their own network.** Complete `next_call.args`
  carries `network` when it differs from the server default. Follow it as
  given; a `repeat_with` patch retains the original call's network.
- **Unread balance changes are not a clean result.** Read
  `incomplete_transactions` (screening: `windows[].incomplete_transactions`),
  `round_trips_unread` and deposit `verdict: "unknown"` before drawing a
  conclusion. Screening withholds unread paths; inbound bridge fulfilment
  names no beneficiary from partial balances. Graph and path traces mark
  unread branches `read_failed`, distinct from `budget` stops; raising a
  budget does not repair a failed read.

- **Dust is not funding.** A 1-MIST spam send is not who funded a wallet, and an
  inflow in a coin nobody prices is spam unless it is at least 1% of the coin's
  supply, or 0.1% from the coin's publisher, which no airdrop can give
  thousands of wallets (a rug deployer's grant to an insider is the case), or
  at least 0.01% sent as a grant: to at most five addresses in its transaction
  and in the funder's sends of that coin within about ten minutes, in amounts
  not all equal. Such a hop carries `unpriced_funding`, whose `basis` says which
  rule counted it (`supply_share` or `targeted_send`, with `send_shape`). Skipped inflows appear as
  `dust_skipped` (in `find_funding_sources`, `dust_skipped_count` unless
  `detail: "full"`); read them rather than assuming nothing was filtered. A hop
  in `prices_unavailable_at` was judged while no coin price loaded, so a
  non-SUI inflow there passed at any value; rerun before trusting it.
  `sponsored_by` (the parties that paid gas for transactions the address sent)
  is reported whenever there is one, not only at a dead end: a wallet can run
  on an address balance with no qualifying inflow of its own, and a gas
  sponsor can be the real operator even when some OTHER inflow (an
  address-poisoning victim's own stolen payment, say) happens to clear the
  funding floor first.
- **A narrow reading off a truncated scan is provisional; an unread one is
  worse.** `classification_provisional` on a fan-out, and `provisional` on a
  funder's popularity, mean the scan stopped before the end of the address's
  history, and the count is a lower bound. `unmeasured` means the scan read
  nothing: `budget` when the shared popularity budget was already spent,
  `read_failed` when its first request failed after retries. A rerun can fix
  the second, and a bigger budget only the first. `find_funding_source` stops
  the walk there rather than treating silence as narrow, and
  `build_wallet_edges` reports such an intermediary in `excluded_intermediaries`,
  never `used_intermediaries`.
- **The gas sponsor is not the sender.** Gas folds into the payer's net SUI, so a
  raw comparison across coins picks the sponsor over the real funder.
- **Obfuscated packages are named by their events.** A transaction calling
  `h86261::h8b64d` and emitting DeepBook events *is* DeepBook.
  `protocols_from_events_only` marks that gap, and it is worth following:
  wrappers are what routers and laundering paths look like.
- **A package ID names one version.** An event's type carries the package that
  defined its struct, which is often an older version than the one called;
  `query_events` and `aggregate_events` rewrite such a type and report
  `event_type_resolution`. An event's emitting `module` carries the ORIGINAL
  id before the `relocate_event_module` cutover (mainnet checkpoint
  69,982,635 on 2024-10-17, testnet 118,397,835 on 2024-10-09, devnet at
  genesis) and the id of the version actually CALLED from it on; the
  filter is queried at whichever id (or both, merged, for a window spanning
  the cutover) your window needs; read `module_scope` for how it was split.
  From the cutover on, any one id (the original included) matches calls
  through that version only, so query the ids in
  `module_scope.other_version_ids` before calling a module's result complete.
  A transaction `function` filter matches calls through one version only, and
  each version holds its own share of a protocol's calls: read
  `function_scope`, and use `all_versions: true` on `query_transactions` to
  read the lineage as one list.
- **Lists start at the newest row.** History, `query_transactions` and
  `query_events` page back from the present unless `order: "oldest"` is set;
  every page states its `order` and the `oldest_shown` / `newest_shown` times.
- **A timeline walk has a budget.** In `build_timeline`, `coverage[].truncated`
  means `per_address` ended that address's walk inside the window. Past its
  `reached_checkpoint` the timeline is missing that address's activity; rerun
  with its `continue_with` bound or a higher `per_address`. A summary that
  omits rows can hide a closing action even in a short window; follow
  `omitted.next_call` before reading the sequence as complete.
- **`token_flow` is the sender's.** On a `get_transaction_history` or
  `build_timeline` row it is the balance change of whoever sent the
  transaction, so a transfer the subject received shows the sender's outflow.
  The subject's own side is `subject_flow`: signed, formatted, with
  `coin_verified`, and keyed by address in a timeline. A row the subject (or,
  in a timeline, a tracked address) sent carries `subject_flow` alone, since
  the two are the same side.

## A worked case

Subject: one address, reported as the destination of a theft.

```
identify_address              → a wallet, not a package. Safe to read as a party.
manage_labels                 → label the two exchanges already known to the case,
                                so a trace stops there instead of running into
                                deposit-sweep noise.
trace_funds                   → 4 hops, stop_reason "reached a labeled entity".
                                unfollowed_recipients lists two not taken —
                                note them, they are branches, not noise.
find_funding_source           → first funded by 0xaec…, 355 SUI.
get_address_fanout  0xaec…    → 33 recipients, narrow. Worth pursuing.
build_wallet_edges  subject   → 17 members, medium, independent_intermediaries 1.
get_transaction     <digest>  → the funding tx paid 20 addresses 5 SUI each.
```

What gets written down: the trace, with digests, `chain-derived`. The funding
source, with its fan-out measurement. **Not** the 17-member cluster, where every edge
ran through one funder, and that funder made a twenty-way uniform payout, which
is a list rather than an operator. The finding records the payout as a fact and
says the cluster was not relied upon.

## When you are done

Stop when the next query cannot change what you would write. Concretely: the
trace has reached a sink you can name, or a party you cannot go past without a
subpoena; the funder is measured rather than assumed; and every claim in the
report carries either a digest or an explicit statement that it could not be
determined.

## Reporting

Say what you checked, what you found, and what you could not determine. A finding
that names someone should carry the transaction digests that support it, so a
reader can verify it without trusting you.

When a result rests on a single intermediary (one shared funder, one sponsor), say
so. Sixteen edges through a single address is one fact stated sixteen times, and
if that address turns out to be a payout service the whole thing falls at once.

Say which tier each claim sits at. A reader who cannot tell your `chain-derived`
statements from your `heuristic` ones will treat them alike, and that is how a
lead becomes an accusation.
